czarpartyd
==================================================

Czarparty is a protocol for the creation and use of decentralised financial instruments such as asset
exchanges, contracts for difference and dividend payments. It uses Czarcoin as a transport layer.
The Czarparty protocol specification may be found `here <https://github.com/Czarcoin/Czarparty>`__.

``czarpartyd`` is the reference client (and server daemon) implementation of the Czarparty protocol.
